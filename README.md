## Project Overview
The Laptop Price Prediction project aims to help users estimate the price of a laptop based on its configuration. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model analyzes various laptop specifications to predict a tentative price, making it a useful tool for consumers and tech enthusiasts. The project includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model training, with a web interface for easy interaction.

This repository, hosted at [https://github.com/Shauryasinghh25/Laptop-Prediction](https://github.com/Shauryasinghh25/Laptop-Prediction), showcases an end-to-end machine learning solution.

## Features
- **Price Prediction**: Predicts laptop prices based on user-input specifications using a trained machine learning model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles noisy data with feature engineering, including encoding categorical variables and handling missing values.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A web application (e.g., using Streamlit or Flask) allows users to input laptop specifications and receive price predictions.
- **Model Performance**: Utilizes robust algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost) for high prediction accuracy.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Includes visualizations to understand the impact of features like brand, RAM, and processor on pricing.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains specifications of various laptops, including:
- Brand (e.g., HP, Dell, Apple)
- Processor (e.g., Intel Core i5, AMD Ryzen)
- RAM (e.g., 4GB, 8GB, 16GB)
- Storage (e.g., HDD, SSD)
- Screen Size (e.g., 13.3 inches, 15.6 inches)
- Operating System (e.g., Windows, macOS)
- Price (target variable)

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammetvarl/laptop-price) or similar platforms and requires preprocessing to handle categorical variables and missing values.
